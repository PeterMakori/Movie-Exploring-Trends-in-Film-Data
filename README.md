This project conducts an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of over 7,000 films to uncover insights into movie budgeting, performance, and correlations between key variables.

The analysis focuses on identifying factors that may influence movie financial success. After cleaning the raw data and handling missing values, relationships are explored between budget, gross earnings, release year, production company & country, and major genre categorizations.

Some highlights from the analysis:

Higher budgets correlate strongly with higher gross earnings
Dramas achieve high earnings with lower budgets than other genres
Companies like Universal Pictures and Warner Bros tend to spend more on productions
Countries like the USA and UK generate more high-budget films
Visualizations help illustrate the main trends and correlations in the data. Techniques used include scatter plots, correlation matrices and heatmaps generated in Matplotlib and Seaborn.
